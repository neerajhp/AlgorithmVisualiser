# Algorithm Visualiser

Welcome to my first React project! Inspired by the various algorithm visualisers out there I designed a simple application to provide some colourful visualisations  for various sorting and shortest path pathfinding algorithms.

## Quick How To 

### Sorting Visualiser

Simple as can be - just select the algorithm you wish to see and hit Visualise! You can pause the animation at any time and restart.
Hit New Array to watch animations on a new random array

Visualise the shortest path between two points on a grid. Select the option to set the origin point, destination point and obstacle nodes. Obstacle nodes are set by holding down your mouse and dragging across the grid. Hit Visualise! to animate.

## Planned Updates

* Additional pathfinding algorithms to be added (Djikstra, A*, Greedy)
* Functionality to reset Pathfinding canvas after intiating an animation
* Functionality to set sort speed and array size

## Acknowledgments

Inspired by a number of visualisers on the web. Special mention to 
* Clement Mihailescu's pathfinding visualiser
* Decadentjs's sorting algorithm visualiser
